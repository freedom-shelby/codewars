Codewars
Solutions for codewars problems I am not too ashamed to put on github.

from Codewars wiki:
Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice

Programming languages are Go and PHP.
